This is a GPS based pedometer, written for QTMoko but should work on
any QTExtended platform.

It compiles and will show basic position and speed data fro the GPS.

TODO
====
Calculate average speed and distance since reset
Display track
Have a go back mode where it will show you the way back. (ie basic compass).
