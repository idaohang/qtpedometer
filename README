This is a GPS based pedometer, written for QTMoko but should work on
any QTExtended platform.

It compiles and will show basic position and speed data for the GPS.
Also have simplistic trip data, like ave speed, trip time and trip
distance

It turns out that the simplistic way of calculating distance travelled
is way inaccurate.  One suggestion I read is to take the speed
returned from the GPS, and use that to calculate the distabce
travelled for each sample. Sounds non-intuitive, but I'll give it a
try.

Looks like it is much more accurate, and means I don't have to mess
with math to smooth out the points.
However we need to set a threshold speed above which the trip distance is recorded.

====
Display track

Have a go back mode where it will show you the way back. (ie basic compass).

Make trip data file configurable (currently hard coded to /media/card/trip.txt

Select US or EURO (mph, miles/ft vs mps, meters).

Set a way point, then show straight line 3D distance from that point using this formula...

alt= current altitude * 6,370,000 // take into account center of earth
// convert from lat, long, alt to cartesian coordinates
x = alt * cos(lat) * sin(long)
y = alt * sin(lat)
z = alt * cos(lat) * cos(long)

// then calculate distance between the two points
dist = sqrt( (x1-x0)^2 + (y1-y0)^2 + (z1-z0)^2 )

// convert degrees to radians
rad = deg * 3.14159 / 180.0
