This is a GPS based pedometer, written for QTMoko but should work on
any QTExtended platform.

It compiles and will show basic position and speed data for the GPS.
Also have simplistic trip data, like ave speed, trip time and trip distance

It turns out that the simplistic way of calculating distance travelled is way inaccurate.
One suggestion I read is to take the speed returned from the GPS, and use that to calculate the distabce travelled for each sample. Sounds non-intuitive, but I'll give it a try.

Display track
Have a go back mode where it will show you the way back. (ie basic compass).
